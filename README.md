# Detecting adulteration in food products

We are building a system to be able to predict the adulteration of food products by certain chemicals/adulterants. This repository contains a variety of code, data, and tools to accomplish the goal. As documentation is sparse, feel free to contact me with questions about how to use any of the code/data.

To see the web tool, visit: http://people.csail.mit.edu/yygu/web_tool. The code/README is in the [web](web/) subdirectory.
