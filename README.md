# Detecting adulteration in food products

We are building a system to be able to predict the adulteration of food products by certain chemicals/adulterants. More information about the project is available here: http://people.csail.mit.edu/yygu/.

## Raw data

The raw data is available at: http://bit.ly/adulteration_data. It is needed to run the programs in this repository. To integrate the data, simply copy the data files to their respective directories in the code.
